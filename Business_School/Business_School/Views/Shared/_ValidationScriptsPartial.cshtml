@* Removed jQuery-based client validation scripts because this project does not use jQuery.
 Server-side validation remains active. If you later add jQuery and want client-side
 unobtrusive validation, restore the scripts:

 <script src="~/lib/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script>
 <script src="~/lib/jquery-validation/dist/jquery.validate.min.js"></script>
 <script src="~/lib/jquery-validation-unobtrusive/jquery.validate.unobtrusive.min.js"></script>
